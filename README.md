Analysis Summary

Summary Statistics - Capomulin and Ramicane have lower mean and median tumor volumes compared to other regimens, indicating that they are more effective than the other drugs in reducing tumor size.

Bar Chart (# of Observed Mouse Timepoints by Drug Regimen) - The bar chart shows that Capomulin and Ramicane have the highest number of observed timepoints which can be attributed to the effectiveness of these treatments where we have more data due to longer observation periods of the drugs compared to the others.

Pie Chart (gender distribution) - Shows a nearly even distribution of gender indicating that there is no bias in genders for drug effectiveness in play.

Boxplots (Tumor Volume Distribution by Treatment Group) - Bos plots of Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin shows that Capomulin and Ramicane have lower median tumor volumes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin, suggesting that Capomulin and Ramicane might be more effective in controlling tumor growth. There are outliers in Infubinol group, indicating variability in this treatment.

Line graph (Capomulin Treatment of Mouse l509) - For the individual mouse treated with Capomulin, there is a general trend of decreasing tumor volume over time, indicating that Capomulin may be effective in reducing tumor size in this mouse and provides a sample of the population of the treatment group.

Scatterplot and Liner Regression (Mouse Weight vs. Average Observed Tumor Volume) - The linear regression model confirms the positive relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume. The slope of the regression line is positive, indicating that as mouse weight increases, the tumor volume also increases.

Correlation - here is a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient of approximately 0.84) between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. This suggests that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes.

Overall the results suggest that Capomulin and Ramicane are the more effective drug regimens for reducing tumor growth with Capomulin showing a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Further investigation and more data analysis with different tests and parameters would be necessary to confirm these findings and determine ith conclusive evidence.
